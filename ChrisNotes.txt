COMP2550 log notes

How do humans differentiate objects?
Colour - mean r, g, b, their standard deviation (to what?)
Contrast ("grayscale"?) and texture
Outline
Shadows (too difficult to implement)
area in vision (high/low placement)
average length/height/"depth"
Shape - round/square/oblong etc?

Due MAR 22 cf notes.
FINAL VERSION DUE 20TH.
FIRST VERSIONS DUE 15TH.


TODO:
latex/word template for report TODO.
contrast (difference between pixels in superpixel) - average grayscale (combined RGB)
avg. length x and y
report scientific structure
area (high/low blue - sky/water)
average R/G/B and their standard deviation (marginal?)
Chris - check psych notes

THOUGHTS:
The code as it stands outputs images which show labels are grossly inaccurate.  Birds are painted as road/building because they are grey (outline/shape problem), hair is labelled as grass because of its colour etc.  Need to think about how we're going to change this.  Animals are still labelled as grass occasionally - why?

Zero columns in confusion matrix - single out why these are caused and see if we can do something about it!

Perimeter length is too ambiguous to delineate different superpixel types (you can have small and large of all kinds)
Standard deviation isn't very robust - is it better to measure the variance in colours? Would this allow for a better profiling ability than the standard deviation?

Need to look into complementary features (not ones that fight against each other)?
lean towards accuracy rather than efficiency.

reference n. 22 is stateOfTheArt on dataset, maybe 8 hours to train the classifiers, a few minutes per image to label.
